# floor.it
A Smart Retail Management System

Countless retail stores donâ€™t have a unifying organization service to display and layout individual floor plans. Floor.it solves this problem through a revolutionary program that takes in a current floor plan image (with or without labels), and through image detection with OpenCV, it outputs a wireframe of that floor plan, without any labels. Managers can use our wireframe to easily relocate anything in their inventory by filling in the wireframe with unique colors to signify different categories of products, establishing a clear and organized map of its current positions in the process. Managers can also explore expanding their own store by adding more shelving units in their wireframe through an add feature in our GUI.
